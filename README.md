# SplitBillProgram
Allows you to split the bill quickly

## Background
On birthdays my friends and I would take the birthday person out to eat for their birthday. We would split the bill after but no one ever wanted to do the math. I made this program so we only had to type the charge amounts in and the program splits it for us. This program gets each individual amount then the non paying people information and splits that charge amoung the paying people.

## Built With
This program was made with Visual Stuido withe C++.

## Instructions
First, input a paying person's name and hit enter. Then you can input dollar amounts and hit enter until all amounts are input. Then type "stop".
You can then add more people or type stop to conitnue. You will now input the non paying info the same way. The name, hit enter, and all of there amounts. Do this until all the non paying people and info are in and type stop. The program will then show the amounts, split the non paying people mount by the number of paying people. It will then out put the result
